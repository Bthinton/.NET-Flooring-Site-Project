A website for a friend's flooring company. I created this website using a mobile first approach,
the website is responsive to all screen sizes via use of media queries. Using JQuery I added a
photo carousel as the banner element, which allows you to scroll through images with either the
"prev" or "next" buttons, as well as the dots beneath the pictures. Another feature would be the
embedded google map element for a little extra user activity. Finally in the footer is a small 
facebook icon that will link to my facebook page.



Clone repo to Visual Studio or download all files then open the flooringsite solution(flooringsite.sln) in your web browser.
/Admin/Index controls all Reading, Editing, and Deleting functions. 
Creating can be done on the "Schedule Today" page or the "Admin" page.
